# Rails: Omnicalc 2 (debugging)

In this project, we'll practice forms and Rails routing by debugging and building out some starter code. You already did this for a Sinatra version of the app; and now you'll do the same in Rails.

Here is our target: [omnicalc-2.matchthetarget.com](https://omnicalc-2.matchthetarget.com/)

Load the assignment and set up a codespace:

LTI{Load Rails Omnicalc-2 assignment}(https://grades.firstdraft.com/launch)[S9ymPy6WCsn18gLbByVbZQ7k]{vfdtzJb5bLYqYwuqgeRKpc5d}(10)[Rails Omnicalc-2 Project]

Then, fork the repository and create your Codespace. Start your live app preview with `bin/dev` once the Codespace is setup.

You should keep the [RCAV Flowchart lesson handy](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/120); it's a good reference for debugging Rails.

When you are ready to get automated feedback run `rake grade`. Before you run `rake grade` you should try and manually match the target; don't rely on `rake grade` to debug; **the better errors page is going to be much more helpful for debugging your starter code.**
